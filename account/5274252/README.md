North East Way EA it is a fully automated “pullback” trading system, which is especially effective in trading on popular “pullback” currency pairs: AUDCAD, AUDNZD, NZDCAD. The system uses the main patterns of the Forex market in trading – the return of the price after a sharp movement in any direction.

The logic is as follows. When an advisor goes into a large drawdown, its goals shift from "making a profit" to "keeping a deposit" and, in order to reduce risks, exits positions at the slightest opportunity This approach allows this EA to work for years with high profitability without blowing up your account. The main profit comes from situations when drawdowns are not deep. If the drawdown is deep, then most likely the positions will be closed with a minimum profit. Therefore, if the drawdown is deep, then the profit is not important, it is more important to unload the deposit by closing the position with a minimum profit.
